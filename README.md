# combineBankStatements
It combines existing bank statements in .csv format to outputs the file. 

I am attaching "Output.zip" file which contains "RunIt.java". 
"RunIt.java" contains the required source code. 
I have used two ArrayLists Domestic and International and then combine both of them so that if required we can use them more smartly. 
I am also attaching "combinedBankOutput.csv" which is the output for my code. 
I have just used core Java(v1.8) features and no external modules have been used. 
The code uses O(nlogn) time complexity and O(n) space complexity. 
If any changes or clarifications are required please let me know.
