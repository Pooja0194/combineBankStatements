## Combine Bank Statements
It combines existing bank statements in .csv format to outputs the file. 

I am attaching "Output.zip" file which contains "RunIt.java". <br>
_"RunIt.java"_ contains the required source code. <br>
I have used two _ArrayLists_ Domestic and International and then combine both of them so that if required we can use them more smartly. <br>
I am also attaching _"combinedBankOutput.csv"_ which is the output for my code. <br>
I have just used core Java(v1.8) features and no external modules have been used. <br>
The code uses _O(nlogn)_ time complexity and O(n) space complexity. <br>
